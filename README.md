-   Notifications are sent using Laravel's built-in `Notification` class.
-   Notification messages are defined in the `App\Notifications` directory.
-   Notifications can be sent using the `notify` method on the `User` model.

-   When a user accepts a friend request, a notification is sent to the sender of request.
